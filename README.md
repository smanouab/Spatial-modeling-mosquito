#Data-Driven Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Mosquito Abundance in Mayotte Using Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches 

This study presents a spatio-temporal statistical modeling framework for mosquito abundance on the island of Mayotte, integrating both environmental and entomological data. Egg and adult mosquito count data, collected across multiple sites and time periods, are jointly analyzed with rainfall, temperature (including lagged effects), and indicators of artificial breeding sites. To capture the complex spatial and temporal dependencies within these heterogeneous datasets, we compare several approaches, including Generalized Additive Models  with spline-based smoothing, Decision Tree Ensembles, Random Forest Regression, and Stochastic Gradient Boosting. Model selection enables the identification and quantification of the most relevant environmental factors influencing mosquito population dynamics. Spatio-temporal predictions are visualized and evaluated through standardized ratio maps, providing an interpretable representation of predicted mosquito presence. This work contributes to the growing field of environmental data analytics by demonstrating how data-driven approaches can effectively support mosquito surveillance and vector-borne disease risk assessment in insular tropical environments.
